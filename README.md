# gameOfLife

The purpose of this was to invent a neat way to showcase "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

**The rules are as followed:**
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

**Tech used:**

<br>CSS
<br>JS - used alongside p5js to draw and sketch algorithms which were mainly array focused.
